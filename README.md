Music & Motion mini-project

The idea for this mini-project is inspired by the installation, CÃ©leste Boursier-Mougenot. 
Creating objects that move around the canvas. When each object toaches each other, the objects makes sound. The sound would change based on the size of the object (Ideally).

By clicking or pressing any key, it will generate new object at random size floating aroud the canvas.
