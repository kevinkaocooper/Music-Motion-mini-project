Music & Motion mini-project

The idea for this mini-project is inspired by the installation, Céleste Boursier-Mougenot.(https://www.sfmoma.org/publication/soundtracks/celeste-boursier-mougenot/)
Creating objects that move around the canvas. When each object touches each other, the objects makes sound. The sound would change based on the size of the object (Ideally).

By clicking or pressing any key, it will generate new object at random size floating around the canvas.
